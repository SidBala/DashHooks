So you have an Amazon Dash button. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could put it to some other use?

That's where DashHooks comes in. DashHooks runs within your WiFi and monitors your Dash Button for presses.
When a press is detected, DashHooks runs the configured script. As simple as that.

    npm install
    npm start
